# Client Folder - React Application

Welcome to the client folder of our project! This directory contains all the necessary files for the frontend of our application, built with React.

## Overview

The client folder is structured to provide a comprehensive base for developing a React application. It includes setup for state management, routing, custom components, and styles without relying on external UI frameworks like Material UI.

## Getting Started

To get the React application up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to this `client` folder.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the project dependencies.
4. After the installation is complete, start the application with `npm start`.
5. Your default web browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:5173` where you can see the running application.

## Key Features

- **State Management:** Demonstrates the use of React's Hooks (e.g., useState, useContext) for managing application state.
- **Routing:** Implements React Router for seamless navigation between different views within the application.
- **Components:** Includes a set of basic React components that form the building blocks of the application's user interface.
- **Custom Styles:** Utilizes CSS for styling components, providing a foundation for customizing the look and feel of the application.

## Further Development

This setup is designed to be a starting point. As you progress through the development, you may add more components, styles, and functionality according to the requirements of your project.

## Conclusion

We hope this README helps you get started with developing the frontend of your application. If you have any questions or encounter issues, please refer to the project documentation or reach out for support.

Happy coding!
